## Qingdao Restaurant Design

![Perspective](../images/articles/design_03/Perspective.jpg)

This is a renovation project for local seaweed house in Qingdao. The main purpose of this project was to renovate old buildings to reduce energy consumption and make economic profit.

![Analysis](../images/articles/design_03/Analysis.jpg)

The restaurant was designed into two parts: dining and communicatng. People eat in the refurbnished seaweed house and have conversation in the newly-build modern house. I designed glass rooms in the south so it could make most use of solar energy. Kitchen garbage could be used as fuel or fertilizer.

Also, in this project I learned how to draw construction details in my project.
