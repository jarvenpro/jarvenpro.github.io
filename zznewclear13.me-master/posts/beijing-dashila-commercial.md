## Beijing Dashila Commercial

![Birdview](../images/articles/design_05/Birdview.jpg)

This is a commercial center design at Dashila, Beijing. It was relatively simple due to lack of time. I designed the shape of this commercial center based on the shape of roads. I placed a public library on the north-west corner, hopping this could attract people to drop by.
