When I started thinking about creating my personal website, I searched the Internet to see if I could find a tutorial for building a personal website. The results were poor and the only suitable tutorial I found was a [tutorial created by DevTips](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLqGj3iMvMa4KeBN2krBtcO3U90_7SOl-A) in 2015. The tutorial was kind of out-dated, so I had a really hard time figuring out my own solution of website development. Therefore, I want to share my experience of website development and hope someone could benefit from my experience.

In my [website development tutorial](https://www.bilibili.com/video/av82125489), I created seven videos including every aspects of my personal website, hoping this well detailed tutorial could help others build their own websites. Creating the tutorial was like reflecting on myself, it was very different from building a website and I really benefited a lot from it.
